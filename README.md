👋 Hi Friends, Excited to share my Power BI project, where I explored data to uncover insights and tell meaningful stories through visuals.

📌 For those who’ve seen this visualization before — yes, it’s inspired by a YouTube project! But as a beginner, working on such structured datasets helped me grasp key concepts and build confidence. I also made several enhancements to make it my own.

Here’s what I learned and applied in this project:

•	🎯 Added custom icons in Power BI to enhance visual storytelling

•	📊 Built interactive KPI banners using layered visuals and dynamic formatting

•	🗺️ Enabled Azure Maps for advanced geospatial analysis

•	🧠 Focused on creating a dashboard that’s not just functional, but also intuitive and client-ready

Let’s begin with the problem statement that shaped the entire dashboard experience 👇

Problem Statement:
A US-based eCommerce company needed a comprehensive sales dashboard to monitor YTD and YoY performance, uncover growth patterns, and spotlight key drivers across products, regions, customer segments, and shipping methods.

📖 Storytelling Insights from the Dashboard

🔍 Sales vs Profit Performance

•	📉 YTD Sales dropped by 0.83% and Quantity Sold by 7.29% compared to last year.

•	💰 Yet, YTD Profit rose by 4.50% and 📈 Profit Margin improved by 5.37%.

•	🧠 This means each sale became more profitable — thanks to smarter pricing or tighter cost control.

•	🎯 To regain volume, the company could explore margin tweaks or targeted promotions, but only after assessing 📊 market price sensitivity.

🗺️ Regional Sales Distribution

•	🌟 West region leads with 32.22% of total sales.

•	🧭 East region, despite its smaller size, follows closely with 28.42%.

•	📉 Central and South regions underperform — a clear opportunity for 🎯 targeted marketing to boost engagement.

🚚 Shipping Type Breakdown

•	✅ Standard Class dominates with 60.51% of orders, yielding ₹800.90K profit and an 11.48% margin.

•	📦 First Class and Second Class contribute 15.1% and 19.22%, both generating solid profits.

•	⚠️ Same Day Delivery, though fast, accounts for just 5.17% and results in a ₹63.63K loss with a –10.67% margin — signaling a need to 🔧 reassess pricing or cost structure.

⏱️ Delivery Timeliness Concern

•	🚨 Over 54.1% of orders were delivered late, risking customer satisfaction and 🔁 retention.

•	📦 Improving delivery timelines could directly reduce churn and build long-term trust.
